• Designed star/snowflake schemas in Lucidchart, identifying fact tables, dimensions, and measures for revenue and equipment analysis.
• Implemented the schema in Oracle SQL, creating fact and dimension tables to support multi-fact reporting.
• Conducted analytic queries to extract insights such as hire/sales revenue trends, seasonal demand, and customer-based patterns.
